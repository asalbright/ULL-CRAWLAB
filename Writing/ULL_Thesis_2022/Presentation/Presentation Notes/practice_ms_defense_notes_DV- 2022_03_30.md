# Presentation Notes
- [x] start - 1:02:59 PM
- [x] title- change title to match thesis title
- [x] 2- space these bullets out a little
- [x] 3-4 try to get through these more quickly
- [x] 5- no hyphen in nonlinearities
- [x] 6- maybe add an explicit figure mapping RL terminology to traditional controls terminology?
- [ ] 7- this is not a block diagram
- [ ] 7- this is not a block diagram 
- [ ] 8- *Q* Does TD3 really work offline?
- [x] 11- 1:13:07 PM
- [x] 12- remove "Equations of Motion"
- [x] 15- 1:16:35 PM
- [x] 17- animate in labels with the equations, rather than having bullets there ahead of time
- [x] 17- include a figure of the system on this slide (small-ish one in top-right, maybe?)
- [x] 18- stop vertial line at top of slide number
- [x] 18- animate in the stutter, so that the audience can focus on single while you are talking about it
- [x] 24- I think you might be better off to show an example before the average performance results. It'll help your audience frame the average.
- [ ] 27- *Q* If you didn't take time to tune hyperparameters, how valid are your results?
- [x] 28- maybe add an annotation ot the figure for each line indicated how much power was used?
- [x] 30- 1:25:57 PM
- [x] 36- 1:28:10 PM
- [x] 37- also not a block diagram
- [x] 38- I like this explanation of what happens in each simulation loop
- [x] 40- animate bullets in with the equations, rather than having bullets there ahead of time
- [x] 40- +/-10%, not +/-90%
- [ ] 40- *Q* Why not change the command?
- [x] 44- frame as expected not not-unexpected
- [ ] 45- change title to Jump Height Performance During Training
- [x] 46- make figure showing only the case you discussed in the presentation (will save you time explaining and avoid audience confusion). Have this one in reserve.
- [x] 48- 1:38:47 PM
- [x] 49- I like this animation. 
- [x] 51- Use actor to generate *commnds* for the simulation, not for the simulation itself (I'm sure you just misspoke)
- [x] 57- 1:45:24 PM
- [ ] 57-58- *Q* What are Discrete and Continuous?
- [ ] Went back to 55 here to describe...
- [x] 60- 1:52:56 PM
- [ ] 63- What does performance (time response) look like before and after the end of traiing change in spring constant, etc?
- [ ] 68- you need to get to hear more strongly... this is a key result
- [ ] 74- 2:00:50 PM
- [ ] 76- need a conclusion
- [ ] Finish- 2:01:52 PM


# Gerald Questions
* Not learning beta term of nonlinear spring?
* 25- seems that some of the efficient agents don't stutter jump?
* How were weighing the goals in the reward/cost function?
* 55- 


# Misc Questions
* Does Boston Dynamics use RL/ML for locomotion
* Why not model-based? What are advantages/disadvantages of that approach?
* Need a good model for this approach... isn't that the difficulty?


# General Notes
* A block diagram is a *very* specific thing to controls engineers. Most of what you show and call block diagrams are not actually block diagrams.
* Try to get through the introduction material a *little* bit more quickly
* I think you might be better off to show an example (or event he best case) before the average performance results. It'll help your audience frame the average.
* Just pick a single case to show for concurrent... "Additional studies of X, Y, and Z are included in the written thesis. Here, I'll just introduce A as a representative case." or similar
* Think about re-showing the Agenda slide to orient the audience between sections. For long presentations, I like to do this, graying out everything but the section I'm about to talk about.
