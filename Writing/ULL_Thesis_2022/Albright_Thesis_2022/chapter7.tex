\chapter{Concurrent Design of a Two-Link Flexible-Legged Jumping System}
\label{chapter6}

Discussion on concurrent design for robotic systems. How does this relate to our system and work? Overview of the system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Figure: system
    \item Table: System parameters
\end{itemize}

\section{Jumping Cases}
The cases which the agents were learning designs and controllers for. 

\section{Mechanical Designs: Simulation}

This is the data basically.

\section{Controller Performance: Simulation}
