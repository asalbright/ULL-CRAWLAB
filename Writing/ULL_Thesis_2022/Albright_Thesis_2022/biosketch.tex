    Andrew Albright was born in Raleigh, North Carolina and spent the majority of his childhood on a farm. He spent the beginning of his academic career in his undergraduate studies at North Carolina State University studying in a mechatronics program. There he grew the desire to continue his academic studies with a passion for robotics. He stumbled across the research within the C.R.A.W.LAB at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and found it to be a place where he could pursue his passion. While there, he  discovered new passions working under Dr. Joshua Vaughan, many which have shaped the work presented in this thesis. He graduated in the Spring of 2022 with a Masters of Mechanical Engineering to continue the pursuit of knowledge in the field of smart-robotics.
