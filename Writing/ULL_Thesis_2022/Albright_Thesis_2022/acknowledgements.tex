I would like to firstly thank my advisor Dr. Joshua Vaughan for his leadership, both academic and personal, during my time here at the university. His support has been invaluable in helping me to understand the underlying ideas behind this material. Additionally, his constant drive to produce high quality work has kept me motivated in my attempts to do the same. I would not have completed this without him. 

I would also like to thank my committee members, Dr. Alan Barhorst, Dr. Anthony Maida and Dr. Brian Post for their input in regards to this work. Along with my lab members during my time in the C.R.A.W.LAB, Gerald Eaglin, Adam Smith, Brennan Moeller, Darcy LaFont, Thomas Poche, and Y (Eve) Dang. Their conversations and advice have greatly assisted me in my efforts to complete this work.

Lastly, I would like to thank the Louisiana Crawfish Board for their financial support, which has allowed me to work knowing my fiscal security was intact.
