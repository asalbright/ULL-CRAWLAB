=====================================

This paper uses reinforcement learning (RL) to find the
parameters of a pogo-stick jumping system. Five reviewers
evaluated the paper and raised major concerns. In
particular, there is a large of body of literature on using
RL for robotic systems, and the novelty and contribution of
the paper over the prior literature are limited. The
simulation results are also weak. Moreover, it is not clear
why RL should be used to solve the underlying problem due
to the simple structure of the problem.
