Comments to the author
======================

This paper uses off-the-shelf RL to find two parameters of
a pogo-stick (spring constant and damping ratio) with a
fixed control profile to optimize its maximum jumping
height. 

=== Strengths ===
+ The proposed is method is motivated well and the related
work is thorough

=== Weaknesses ===
- Novelty and Setup: As the authors pointed out, there has
been an existing large body of research that uses RL for
design, or joint optimization of policies and the robot
topology. This paper does not provide any novelty in this
regard as it uses an existing RL method in an overly
simplified environment in simulation. 
- Method and Experiments: Why use the RL formulation when
the setup is not a sequential decision problem? The reward
is provided as one-time signal which the agent uses to
change its spring constant and damping ratio outputs. I
would also like to see comparison to at least one
gradient-free optimization which does not follow the RL
formulation (for example, CMAES).
